# SQL-Challenge-Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts
## Performed Data Modeling,Data Engineering & Data Analysis

#### Data Modeling:
####### Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables using https://www.lucidchart.com/.

##### Data Engineering:
####### Used the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.Specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
####### Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table

###### Answered following Questions using Data Analysis:
####### Details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
####### First name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
